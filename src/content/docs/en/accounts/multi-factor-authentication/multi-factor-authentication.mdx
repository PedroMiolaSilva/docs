**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** is an electronic verification method used to secure logins. With MFA, the user must provide at least two pieces of identity evidence to be able to login into their account. In this case, it is a combination of a password and a third-party authenticator application on a mobile device.

> Before you enable this setting on **Real-Time Manager (RTM)**, make sure your mobile device supports an MFA application, such as Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator, by going into your app store (iOS' App Store or Android's Google Play, for example), searching, and downloading it.

## 1. Enabling MFA on Real-Time Manager 

You can enable MFA when creating a new user, to set it up to active users, or to secure access to your account.

Enabling MFA to your account:

1. Access **[Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/)**.
2. Click the **Account Menu** on the top right corner and select **User Preferences**.
3. Enable the MFA switch.
4. Click **Save** to finish the process.

Enabling MFA to existing users:

1. Access **[Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/)**.
2. Click the **Account Menu** on the top right corner and select **Users Management**.

5. Click **Save** to finish the process.

## 2. Setting up an MFA mobile application 

To install an authenticator application on your mobile phone, consult your operational system's app store (such as iOS' App Store or Android's Google Play). You can use Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator applications, for instance.

Once you have downloaded the application and logged in, follow these steps to connect Azion's account to your chosen authenticator application:

1. Look for the **+** button and click it.
2. Select the account type you are going to add. The camera will start.
3. Scan the QR code that appears when you log into **Real-Time Manager**.
4. Type the six-digit code and click **Verify Code**.

Because of MFA, it is necessary to have access to your mobile phone to log into RTM, providing the 6-digit code.

## 3. Logging to Real-Time Manager using MFA 

Read below to log into RTM with Multi-Factor Authentication activated:

1. On RTM's login page, insert your login credentials (e-mail and password) and click **Sign In**.
2. Start your authenticator application.
3. Type the six-digit code in the specified space on RTM and click **Verify**.

## 4. Resetting MFA 

In case of loss or theft of your mobile phone, you will not be able to log into RTM unless an *Account owner* resets the MFA function.

> Multi-Factor Authentication can be reset only if the MFA enforcement is not mandatory for the account's users.

To do so, you can ask for an Account owner user to deactivate your MFA function. In case you are an *Account Owner*, proceed as follows:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Click the **Account Menu** on the top right corner and select **Users Management**.
3. Select the desired user to access their profile.
4. Disable the MFA switch.
5. Click **Save** to finish the process.

If you are the only Account owner within the account, it is necessary to contact the [support](mailto:support@azion.com) team to have the MFA reset.

## 5. Enforcing MFA usage for all users belonging to an account

MFA provides an extra level of security to protect your user credentials. Applying two-step authentication for all users requires user management access, that is, only users with *Account Owner* privileges can enable this setting.

Enforcing MFA for all users linked to an account:

1. Access **[Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/)**.
2. Click the **Account Menu** on the top right corner and select **Account Settings**.
3. Under **Authentication Settings**, enable the **Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication** switch.

   > When you enable this item, MFA will be mandatory for all users of the account.
4. Click **Save** to finish the process.

To disable this setting, follow the steps above, disable the **Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication** switch and click **Save**.

## 6. Unlink MFA usage from an account

You can restore your account's MFA usage. If you have lost or replaced the phone used to authenticate your login, or want to authenticate using another device such as a new phone or computer.

To do so, you can ask for an Account owner user to restore your MFA. In case you are an *Account Owner*, proceed as follows:

1. Access **[Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/)**.
2. Click the **Account Menu** on the top right corner and select **Users Management**.
3. Select the user(s) you want to unlink from MFA use.
4. Click the **Restore Authenticator** button located at the bottom of the page in the **Restore Multi-Factor Authenticator** section.
5. On the verification pop-up, click **Restore**.

> From that point on, the user will be required to enable the authenticator again the next time he logs in.
