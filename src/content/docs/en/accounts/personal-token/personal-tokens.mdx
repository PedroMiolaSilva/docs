**Personal Tokens** are a string of characters used to authenticate your user and access to certain interfaces and tools. You can create a long-lived authentication **Personal Token** in [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) to call [Azion APIs](https://api.azion.com/) or to execute commands in the [command-line interface (CLI)](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/cli/).

## Creating a Personal Token

To create your **Personal Token**, proceed as follows:

1. Access [**Real-Time Manager**](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. In the **Account Menu** on the top right corner, select **Personal Tokens**.
3. Click the **Add a personal token** button.
4. Fill in the required fields:
   * Personal Token name
   * Expires in
   > You can choose the token expiration date between 1, 7, 15, 30, 90 days, 1 year, or a custom date.
   * Personal Token description (optional)

> The Personal Token's expiration date should be chosen according to your project needs and duration. For use with APIs and CLI, for example, you can create a long-lived authentication token for practicality but you may have to be more careful and take extra security measures.

5. Click the **Create Token** button.
6. Click the **visibility** icon in the **Personal Token** field to see your token.
7. Click the **copy token** icon to copy your token.

> You can only see your token when you first create it. After clicking the **OK** button, your token *can no longer be seen or copied* and you won't be able to access it again. *Treat your tokens like passwords and save them* in a safe place right after you create them.

You can create as many personal tokens as you like and you can view them under **Personal Tokens** in the **Account Menu** on the top right corner of **RTM**. You canâ€™t modify a token once it's created, but you will be able to see its *scope*, *last modified date*, and *expiration date*.

## Revoking a Personal Token

To revoke your Personal Token, proceed as follows:

1. Access [RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. In the **Account Menu** on the top right corner, select **Personal Tokens**.
3. Hover over the Personal Token item you want to delete and click the **trash can** icon.
4. On the verification pop-up, type **delete**.
5. Click the **Delete** button.

That's it! You'll see a message confirming the deletion of your token.
