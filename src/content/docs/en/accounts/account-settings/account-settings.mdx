## Authentication Settings

### Social Login

If you're the *Account Owner*, you can enable and disable the **Social Login** functionality using its switch. When it's enabled, users linked to the account can authenticate to [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) using the supported social networks. Otherwise, they have to log in using their email and password. Learn more about it on the [Social Login](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/accounts/social-login/) page.

   > When you enable **Social Login**, it applies to all users of the account.

Click the **Save** button after changes to finish the process.

Once Social Login is enabled, users can [access RTM](https://manager.azion.com/) via Social Login on their next login.

   > Currently, Azion supports Social Login with GitHub and Google accounts.


### Multi-Factor Authentication

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** provides an extra level of security to protect your users' credentials. Only the *Account Owner* can enable these settings. 

To enforce MFA for all users linked to the account, activate the **Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication** switch and click the **Save** button to finish the process.

   > When MFA is enabled, it'll be mandatory for all users of the account.
