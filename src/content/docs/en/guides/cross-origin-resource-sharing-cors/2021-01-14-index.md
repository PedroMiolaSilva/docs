# Setting up Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) 

**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** is a mechanism for using HTTP headers to give access permission to specific resources that are on a different origin server to the document in use.

An example of a cross-origin request is an HTML page provided by domain “A”, which requests a file, such as a CSS stylesheet or JavaScript, provided by domain “B”. For security reasons, most browsers prevent cross-origin HTTP requests originated by scripts.

Here are some examples of CORS configurations:

> 1. [CORS permission for all origins](#cors-permission-all-origins)
> 2. [CORS permission for specific origins](#cors-permission-specific-origins)

---

## 1. CORS permission for all origins {#cors-permission-all-origins}

To allow CORS within a configuration, without any restriction on the origin:

1. Log in to [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Select **Products Menu** > **Edge Application**.
3. Edit the required **Edge Application** configuration.
4. In the **Rules Engine** tab, create a new rule in **Response Phase**, as in the following example:

| **Name:** | CORS |
|-----------|------|
| **Criteria:** | **if** ${*uri*} **starts with** */your-uri* |
| **Behavior:** | **then** Add Response Header *Access-Control-Allow-Origin*: * |

---

## 2. CORS permission for specific origins {#cors-permission-specific-origins}

To enable CORS within a configuration for some specific origin servers, you will need the  [Application Acceleration] ({% tl documentation_products_application_acceleration %}) product.

1. Log in to [RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Select **Products Menu** > **Edge Application**.
3. Edit the required **Edge Application** configuration.
4. In the **Main Settings** tab, activate the **Application Acceleration** switch.
5. Click the **Save** button.
6. In the **Rules Engine** tab, create a new rule in **Response Phase**, as in the following example:

| **Name:** | CORS |
|-----------|------|
| **Criteria:** | **if** *${http_origin}* **is equal** *http://your.domain1.com*<br>**or** *${http_origin}* **is equal** *http://your.domain2.com*<br>**or** *${http_origin}* **is equal** *http://your.domain3.com* |
| Behavior: | **then** Add Response Header *Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ${http_origin}* |
