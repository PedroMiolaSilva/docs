# How to run serverless functions on the Azion Edge platform

[Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/) is a service of Azion's Edge Computing platform that allows you to program and execute serverless functions, without the need to provision or manage servers.

## Running the Azion - Hello World function on an edge application

You can create your own functions or use any of those already available on the [Azion Marketplace](https://marketplace.azion.com/).

To demonstrate how to instantiate and run a function on an edge application, this guide will use:

- The pre-configured *Azion - Hello World* function.
- A previously created edge application.

To run the function, it must:

- Be instantiated in an edge application.
- Its activation criteria and behaviors must be defined within the Rules Engine.

### Instantiating an edge function

**Inside your Edge Application page, on** [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/):

1. Go to the **Functions** tab.
2. Click on **Add Function**.
3. Name your function instance `Hello World function`.
4. Select the *Azion - Hello World* function and Save it.

### Configuring activation criteria and behavior



5. Browse to the **Rules Engine** tab.
6. Click on the **New Rule** button > select **Request Phase**.
7. Add a name to the *request phase rule*.
8. Configure the criteria to be:

> If: $(uri) is equal `/hello-world`.



9. On the **Behaviors** section, choose **Run Function**, then select *Hello World function* and click on **Save**.

> Wait a few minutes for the propagation to be completed.



10. After a few minutes, try to access the application using its domain. Example:

`xxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/hello-world`

Now, you've successfully configured and instantiated an edge function to work on an edge application.
