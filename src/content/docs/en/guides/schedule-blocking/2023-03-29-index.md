## 2. Using the solution {#using-solution}

### 2.1 Setting up the Edge Firewall rule {#edge-fw-rules-setup}

To instantiate the Schedule Blocking solution, follow the steps:

1. In the **Products menu**, select **Edge Firewall** in the **SECURE** section.
2. Click the **Add Rule Set** button.
3. Give an easy to remember name to your new rule.
4. Select the domains you want to protect with the function.
5. Turn the **Edge Functions** switch on.
6. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now you've instantiated the rule for your function.

---

### 2.2 Setting up the solution {#edge-fw-rules-solution}

To instantiate the Schedule Blocking solution, while still on the **Edge Firewall** page, select the **Functions** tab and follow these steps:

1. Click the **Add Function** button.
2. Give an easy to remember name to your instance.
3. On the dropdown menu, select the **Schedule Blocking** function.

This action will load the function, showing a form with the source code of the function and, just above it, two tabs: **Code** and **Args**. 

By clicking the **Code** tab, you'll be able to navigate through the source code but not to change it. In the same box, there's the **Args** tab, which is where you’ll pass the parameters you want to use with your solution.

The **Args** tab will load a `JSON` file that looks like this:

```JSON
{
  "schedule": [
    {
      "action": "deny",
      "execute_action_when": "in_interval",
      "interval": {
        "starts_at_utc": "00:00",
        "finishes_at_utc": "00:59"
      },
      "week_days": {
        "Sun": true,
        "Mon": true,
        "Tue": true,
        "Wed": true,
        "Thu": true,
        "Fri": false,
        "Sat": true
      }
    },
    {
      "action": "drop",
      "execute_action_when": "not_in_interval",
      "interval": {
        "starts_at_utc": "01:00",
        "finishes_at_utc": "20:00"
      },
      "week_days": {
        "Mon": true,
        "Tue": true
      }
    },
    {
      "action": "static_response",
      "execute_action_when": "in_interval",
      "static_response_data": {
        "status": 503,
        "message": "You can write a custom message here",
        "html": "<!-- Some HTML can go here -->"
      },
      "interval": {
        "starts_at_utc": "20:00",
        "finishes_at_utc": "23:59"
      },
      "week_days": {
        "Sun": true,
        "Sat": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The arguments that you can pass on this `JSON` file are the following:

| Atribute | Data Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `action`| String | Defines the action which the function will execute whenever a request matches the trigger criteria. <br><br>Possible values are: <br>`Deny`: it will close the request with an HTTP 403 Forbidden response.<br>`Drop`: it will close the request without sending any response to the client.<br>`static_response`: it will close the request with a static response to it. |
| `execute_action_when` | String | Possible values are:<br>`in_interval`<br>`not_in_interval` <br><br>When this argument is set to `in_interval`, the `action` will be executed whenever this function is called during the defined time interval.<br>When this argument is set to `not_in_interval`, the `action` will be executed whenever this function is called out of the defined time interval. |
| `interval` | Dictionary of Strings | Defines the time interval.<br>The values must be in the format "HH:MM", based on a 24 hour clock.<br>Note: This function is used in the UTC time zone. |
| `interval.starts_at_utc` | String | Defines the starting time of the interval. |
| `interval.finishes_at_utc` | String | Defines the ending time of the interval. |
| `week_days` | Dictionary of Booleans | Defines the days of the week when the function will be executed.<br>The indexes of the dictionary represent each day of the week. They are expected to use a 3 letter format (EEE), starting with capital case. If an invalid day is used, it'll be ignored.<br>Note that if a day is not present in the dictionary, it will be considered as `false`. |
| `static_response_data` | Dictionary of Strings | Allows the customization of the static response page which will be returned whenever the action is set to `static_response`. |
| `static_response_data.status` | Number | The status code used in the static response. |
| `static_response_data.message` | String | Allows you to customize the message displayed in the static response page. |
| `static_response_data.html` | String | Allows you to provide a custom HTML to be used when delivering the static response. |

> Note that for `static_response` parameter in `action`, you can define the status code that will be used in the response, as well as set a custom HTML page that will be delivered to your users.


Click the **Save** button and you're done. Your Edge Firewall solution is instantiated.

## 3. Setting up the Rules Engine {#rules-engine}

Finally, you must set up the [Rules Engine]({% tl documentation_products_edge_firewall_rules_engine %}) to configure the *behavior* and the *criteria* to run the function.

Still in the **Edge Firewall** page, select the **Rules Engine** tab and follow these steps:

1. Click the **New Rule** button.
2. Give a name to the rule.
3. Select a criteria to run and catch the domain you want to run the solution on.
4. Below, select a *behavior* to the *criteria*. In this case, it’ll be **Run Function**. Then, select the adequate **Schedule Blocking** function according to the name you gave it in the instantiate step.
5. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now the Schedule Blocking solution is running for every request made to the domain you indicated.
