# Limits GraphQL API

To keep **GraphQL API** working with enhanced performance, the API has predetermined limits you must pay attention to. See which are these limits next.

> 1. [Query rows limit](#query-rows-limit)
> 2. [Selected fields limit](#selected-fields-limit)

---

## 1. Query rows limit {#query-rows-limit}

You can query up to *10,000 rows per query*. The **limit** field in your query controls this restriction, and you can set it as you desire as long as it doesn’t surpass the **GraphQL API** limit. If you surpass it,  the API will return an Error Response message informing the issue.

---

## 2. Selected fields limit {#selected-fields-limit}

When you’re querying for datasets’ fields, the maximum value of selected fields is of *35 fields per query*. If you surpass the fields' limit, the API will return an Error Response message informing the issue.

See the [Error Responses]({% tl documentation_graphql_error_responses %}) page for more details on the messages regarding limit errors.
