# Edge Functions Code Editor

The new code editor for [Edge Functions]({% tl documentation_products_edge_functions %}) is the best way to get started developing your edge functions on the Azion platform. It's a web-based code editor that makes it easier and more intuitive to develop at the edge of the network. It's empowered by the [Monaco Code Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/docs.html), used in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), so if you're used to VS Code, you'll get familiar with it right away. The Monaco Code Editor main features available for the **Edge Functions Code Editor** are:

- Debugging
- Code refactor
- Code explanation
- Code generator
