# Azion Edge Runtime

The **Azion Edge Runtime** is a set of tools for developing applications at the **Edge**. The Azion Edge Runtime allows you to write JavaScript [edge functions]({% tl documentation_products_edge_functions %}) built on Web standards.

**Edge functions** help you to implement the business logic and create serverless applications, at the edge of the network, closer to users.

With Azion Edge Runtime, you can use a set of **Web APIs**, such as:

- Network
- Encoding and Decoding
- Web Streams
- Standards
- V8 Primitives

## Jamstack

[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) is an approach that separates data and business logic from the web experience layer, improving flexibility, scalability, performance, and maintainability.

You can experience the **Jamstack** architectural approach deploying an application on the Azion Edge Platform.

### Supported frameworks {#supported-frameworks}

- [Next.js]({% tl documentation_products_edge_functions_runtime_supported_frameworks_nextjs %})

> **Attention**: in case of importing repositories based on other frameworks, the edge application won't complete the building process.
> **Note**: Azion is constantly working to provide support for more frameworks. Any updates will be announced through the [Changelog](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/changelog/), the [Documentation page](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/), and official communication channels.
