**Web Application Firewall (WAF) Custom Allowed Rules** is a feature that allows you to instantiate WAF Rules specifically for the need of your edge application, considering the actual application traffic, request, and data. Use WAF Custom Allowed Rules to amplify the security levels of your application and also to stop false positives.

## Prerequisites

To instantiate **Custom Allowed Rules** in a **WAF Rule Set**, you must have an **Edge Firewall** configuration with the **Web Application Firewall** module activated.

## WAF internal rules

Your **WAF Custom Allowed Rules** can be based on actual requests that were marked by WAF as possible threats. You can also allow a custom rule in case of tests and false positives.

When creating custom allowed rules for a WAF configuration, it's necessary to choose between the available internal rules for its composition. 

See the list of all available internal rules below:

| Rule ID | Description                                                                                                                                |

| 13      | Invalid POST format. <br/> **Note**: requests that fall under rule 13 will be blocked in some cases, even if the WAF is operating in *learning* mode. Read the [Rules Engine for Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/rules-engine/) documentation for the definition of learning/blocking modes. Read this guide [how to check your WAF mode](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-check-your-waf-mode/).                                                                                                                      |

## Testing Rules in Staging Environment

To ensure that your Custom Allowed Rules are working as intended, it's recommended that you test them in a staging environment before deploying them to production. A staging environment allows you to simulate real-world traffic and catch potential issues without affecting your live application.

1. **Set up a staging environment**: create a separate instance of your application that mirrors your production environment as closely as possible.
2. **Deploy rules**: implement your Custom Allowed Rules in this staging environment.
3. **Simulate traffic**: generate traffic patterns that resemble expected user behavior and potential threat scenarios.
4. **Monitor logs and alerts**: check the logs to verify that legitimate requests are allowed and false positives are minimized.
5. **Adjust and optimize**: based on the results, fine-tune your rules to improve accuracy and effectiveness.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your WAF Custom Allowed Rules provide the desired security enhancements without unintended consequences.
