The debugging process allows checking if the rules, messages, and variables you've created are working properly. When you constantly debug an edge application or an edge function, you improve your monitoring process and you're able to identify errors and then fix them.


## Edge applications

To debug your edge application rules:

<LinkButton outlined link="/en/documentation/products/guides/debug-rules/" label="debug rules created with rules engine" variant="secondary" /> <br></br>

## Edge functions

To debug your edge functions:

<LinkButton outlined link="/en/documentation/products/guides/debugging-functions-data-stream/" label="debug edge functions on Data Stream" variant="secondary" /> <br></br>

<LinkButton outlined link="/en/documentation/products/guides/debugging-functions-graphql/" label="debug functions using graphql api" variant="secondary" /> <br></br>
