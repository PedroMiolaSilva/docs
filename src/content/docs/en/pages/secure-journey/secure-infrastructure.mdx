# Secure an Infrastructure

Use Origin Shield to secure your infrastructure.

Origin Shield works as a list of IP/CIDR addresses used in Azion's Edge, providing assurance of safe IPs to allow access. The list is maintained by Azion and is available via Azion Console and API. However, each client must create automation to ensure their security policies are always up-to-date with the Origin Shield addresses. Misclassification of device groups may occur if the automation is not correctly set up to reflect the latest IP addresses.

## Step 1. Enable Origin Shield

To access the Origin Shield list, you must have:

- The [Network Layer Protection module](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/edge-firewall-configure-main-settings/#modules) enabled.
- Be subscribed to the Origin Shield add-on.
  - Contact the [sales team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/) to subscribe to this feature.

## Step 2. Access the List of Addresses

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.api">API</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > select **Network Lists**.
2. Select **Azion Origin Shield**.
3. On the **List** field, you can copy the IP addresses list.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) > select **Network Lists**.
2. Select **Azion Origin Shield**.
3. On the **List** field, you can copy the IP addresses list.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.api">
1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/)

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/network_lists' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

2. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "count": 4,
  "total_pages": 1,
  "schema_version": 3,
  "links": {
    "previous": null,
    "next": null
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 2345,
      "last_editor": "last.editor@azion.com",
      "last_modified": "2023-03-27T21:19:27.996870Z",
      "list_type": "ip_cidr",
      "name": "Azion Origin Shield",
      "country_list": [],
      "ip_list": [
        "192.168.0.5"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

3. On the `ip_list` field, you'll receive all IPs added by Azion. You can copy the IP addresses list.

:::note
Clients with Origin Shield receive an email every time the list is updated and have *7 days* to update automations, when necessary, to retrieve the new list.

## Step 3. Automate New Address Additions

After having access and checking the list of IP addresses provided by Origin Shield, you can create an automation with Rules Engine, ensuring your infrastructure is always protected with the most recent version of safe IPs. [TECHWRITER TODO: INSERT INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO AUTOMATE THIS PROCESS]
