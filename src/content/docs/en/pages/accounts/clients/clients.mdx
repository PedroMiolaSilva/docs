**Real-Time Manager** allows you to create separate accounts, called **Clients**, for each of the affiliates in your group of companies.

Thus, you can manage the group's accounts independently, with different Account owners, to streamline your day-to-day processes even further.

Below, you will find guidelines on how to add _Client_ accounts to your group of companies and how to manage your affiliates' users individually on the **Real-Time Manager**.

> _The Clients feature is only available for accounts of the Group type._

## Creating your Client accounts

Log into the **[Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/)** as the Account owner and follow these steps:

1. In the **Groups** tab, select the company for which you want to create a Client type account.
2. On the **Account menu**, of the group type account, select the **Clients** option.
3. On the Clients screen, click the **Add client** button. Follow the instructions described in [Setting up Client accounts](/en/documentation/products/accounts/clients/#settingupclientaccounts) to create and activate independent accounts for your affiliates.

> _To ensure data security, we recommend keeping login access information confidential_.
