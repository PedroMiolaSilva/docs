Redirect requests from one URL to another. Can be helpful during maintenance or downtime.

```js
  const destinationURL = "https://www.azion.com/en/"
  const statusCode = 301
  
  async function handleRequest(request) {
    return Response.redirect(destinationURL, statusCode)
  }
  
  addEventListener("fetch", async event => {
    event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
  })
```

## Creating a Maintenance Page Using Azion Functions

To create a maintenance page using Azion's Edge Firewall, you can define specific criteria and behaviors with custom HTTP responses. Follow the steps below:

1. **Define Criteria**: Set up criteria based on your needs, such as URL patterns or request methods that should trigger the maintenance page.

2. **Create a Custom HTTP Response**: Use Edge Functions to return a custom HTTP response. You can include an HTML message indicating that the site is under maintenance.

```js
  async function handleRequest(request) {
    const maintenanceHTML = `<html><body><h1>Site Under Maintenance</h1><p>We are currently performing scheduled maintenance. Please check back soon.</p></body></html>`;
    return new Response(maintenanceHTML, {
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' },
    });
  }

  addEventListener("fetch", async event => {
    event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
  })
```

3. **Deploy and Test**: Deploy the function to your Azion Edge Application and test it to ensure it behaves as expected.

## Updating Images in Edge Functions

To update images in Edge Functions, you may need to use base64 encoding. Follow the steps below:

1. **Base64 Encoding**: Convert your image to a base64 string.

2. **Embed in the Function**: Embed the base64 string within the HTML or JSON payload served by your Edge Function.

3. **Support Options**: If you require assistance with image updates, Azion provides support options to help you through the process. [TECHWRITER TODO: INSERT INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO ACCESS AZION SUPPORT OPTIONS FOR IMAGE UPDATES]

By following these steps, you can effectively manage maintenance workflows and update content using Azion's Edge Functions.
