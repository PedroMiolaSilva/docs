> Credentials are used solely for the **Edge Orchestrator**. To generate tokens for APIs, head to the [API documentation](https://api.azion.com/).

You can generate credentials to use and authenticate our services by following these steps:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Access the **Credentials** page on the **Account menu** on the top right corner.
3. Click the **Add Credential** button.
4. Choose a name for your credential.
5. Describe how or by whom the credential will be used in the **Description** field in **Settings**.

   > Credential used for Edge Nodes registration, for example.

6. Click the **Save** button.

> **Note:** the token will be generated after the credential is saved.

The following options are available when clicking on the created credential:

- Copy the generated token.
- Delete your credential.
- Edit your credential. Here you can update your credential's name, description and status (active/inactive).

To copy your token click on the **Copy token** icon. Then, you will see the following message: *Token copied to the clipboard!*

If you wish to delete the **Credential**, click the *Delete* icon. You will see a confirmation message on the screen, and then click the **Confirm** button to delete your credential.
