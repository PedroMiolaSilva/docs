Creating custom rules amplifies the breadth and depth of security levels in your application. You can define **Custom Allowed Rules** to manage and define internal rules when configuring your **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**.

That means you're able to set up and manage such lists according to the behavior and traffic between your application and the internet.

## 1. List of internal rules

When creating **Custom Allowed Rules** in your **WAF** setup, it's necessary to choose between the available internal rules (see list below) for its composition: 

| Rule ID | Description                                                                                                                               |
|:-------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

> **Warning**: Requests that fall under rules 1 to 18 will be blocked, even if the WAF is operating in *learning* mode. Read the [Rules Engine for Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/rules-engine/) documentation for the definition of learning/blocking modes. Read this guide [how to check your WAF mode](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-check-your-waf-mode/).


## 2. Setting up a Custom Allowed Rule

To bring a new **WAF Rule Set** into action, make sure to add it into a Rule in *Behaviors* inside the **Edge Firewall Rules Engine**.

1. After defining the WAF configuration, head to the *Allowed Rules* tab.
2. Click *Add Rule*.
3. From the *Rule ID* list, choose a protocol to define the set-up.
4. In the *Rule Description*, write down a suggestive description to identify the ruleset.
5. The *Path* will be used to restrict the range of a matching zone. If this is undesired, leave it blank.
6. In the *Match Zone* fields, choose the matching zones you'd like to put into the allowlist. You can create as many *Match Zones* as desired, according to the type of setup:
  * Use *Query String* or *Conditional Query String* to insert all GET arguments or one named argument into the allowlist. For example, the "search" argument.
  * Use *Request Header* or *Conditional Request Header* to put all HTTP request headers or one named header into the allowlist. For example, the Cookie header.
  * Use *Request Body* or *Conditional Request Body* to insert all POST arguments or one named argument into the allowlist. For example, the "search" argument.
  * Use *Raw Body* to use the unparsed (raw) request body into the allowlist.
  * Use *File Name (Multipart Body)* to put the file name of a multipart POST containing a file into the allowlist.
  * Use *Path* to add the path itself or one named path into the allowlist.
7. Once you're done configuring your new **Custom Allowed Rule**, click the **Save** button.

#### Using Regular Expressions

To use this functionality correctly some configuration patterns must be followed:

* Our Regex engine uses only regular expressions compatible with the standards of the [Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE)](https://www.pcre.org/) library.
* The use of Regex only applies to *Conditional* type *Match Zones* with *Content Type* having key and value semantics.

  ![Regex Conditional](https://www.azion.com/static/images/uploads/doc/regex_conditional.png)

* When using Regex you have to enable the `This Match Zone uses Regex` switch.

  ![Regex switch](https://www.azion.com/static/images/uploads/doc/regex_switch.gif)

* Alternation operators are not yet supported by our **WAF**.

> Follow all the requirements above to avoid errors when creating your rule.
