# Access Permissions

**Edge Firewall** uses [**Real-Time Manager**](https://manager.azion.com/) per-team permissions system. This way, you have more flexibility when defining the functions and roles of users and teams.

## Users and teams

The **Real-Time Manager** enables association between any user and a team. You can assign the following access permissions for each team:

| Access                 | Permission                                                                                                  |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| View Edge Firewall     | It grants permission to view Edge Firewall Rule Sets, but does not allow creation, removal or modification. |
| Edit Edge Firewall     | It grants permission to view, create, edit and remove Rule Sets from Edge Firewall.                         |
| View Network Lists     | It grants permission to view Network Lists, but does not allow creation, removal or modification.           |
| Edit Network Lists     | It grants permission to view, create, edit and remove Network Lists.                                        |
| View Security Settings | It grants permission to view WAF Rule Sets and Digital Certificates (with the exception of the private key), but does not allow creation, removal or modifications. |
| Edit Security Settings | It grants permission to view, create, edit and remove WAF Rule Sets and Digital Certificates.               |

### How to configure Edge Firewall permissions:

1. Access [**Real-Time Manager**](https://manager.azion.com/) with an administrator account (admin) and go to the **Account Menu** on the top right corner:
2. Select **Team's Permissions**.
3. Edit existing teams or add a new team in *Add Team*.
4. Add a name for your team if you are creating a new team.
5. Confirm ***View/Edit*** ***Edge Firewall*** or ***View/Edit*** ***Network Lists***.
6. Select the *Active* field to activate your selection.
7. Click the *Save* button to save your configuration.
8. Access *Users Management* in the same menu.
9. Edit existing users or add a User in *Add User*.
10. In case you add new users, fill in the fields in *User Profile* and *Contact Information*.
11. In Security Settings, activate or deactivate the Account Owner field according to the user access permission.

    > *Account Owners* have full access to all resources, including account management and solutions.
    >
    > *Non-owners* have restricted access to the solution management, based on the team's permissions.

12. Add the teams whose permissions the user will inherit.
13. Click the *Save* button to save your configuration.

    > If you want to add an extra security layer to your account, enable the *Multi-Factor Authentication Field*.
