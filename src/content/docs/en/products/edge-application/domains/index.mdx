# Domains

Domains is part of Azion's [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) platform. This functionality provides a domain generation service. With it, you can create a domain with a TLS certificate, provided by Azion, at no additional cost. This step is part of the process of creating an **Edge Application** in **RTM**. Domains is also available in a staging environment.

> You can use the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/) to automate domain creation and configuration.

## 1. How it works

Domains is a standard feature available for all **Edge Applications** on Azion. When you create an **Edge Application** in **RTM**, you must go to **Domains**, configure, and connect it to an **Edge Application**. If you wish, you can use it to deliver your content over HTTPS, avoiding TLS certificate issuance costs, or use the domain provided by Azion.

## 2. Environment

Before going operational, you can activate a testing configuration to preview setups. When creating a new Domain, select the Environment type in the **Settings** > **Environment** section:

- **Production**: select this **Environment** to start operating, making the **Domain** available in production.

- **Preview**: choose this **Environment** to create a **Domain** for testing. This configuration won't impact the **Production** environment.

When selecting the **Production** environment, you'll receive a domain name `xxxx.map.azionedge.net`. When selecting the **Preview** environment, you'll receive a domain name `xxxx.preview.azionedge.net`.

To enable the **Preview** environment selection, contact our [Sales Team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).

## 3. CNAME

CNAME is the standard service responsible for creating CNAME settings, making it possible to replace the domains within Azion. This configuration is also located in **Domains**. Each domain can accommodate up to 50 CNAMEs.

When you add a domain, the **CNAME Access Only** switch is automatically turned on, which means that access to your edge application using the `map.azionedge.net` domain will be blocked. You may disable this setting, if desired.

## 4. Digital Certificates

To use your domain in HTTPS, you'll need a TLS certificate (X.509). Without additional costs, you may include your TLS certificates in [Real-Time Manager](http://manager.azion.com) or generate a *Let's Encrypt*â„¢ certificate, which will be automatically managed by Azion.

[Find out more about Digital Certificates](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/digital-certificates/).

## 5. Support for Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)

Azion's Domains also have **Support for Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)**, an authentication method for users and visitors that validates the digital certificate on both sides of a request, client, and edge (server). Adding support for mTLS to your **Edge Application** ensures a more secure *TLS/TLS handshake* and is an *Open Banking* requirement.

> **Tip**: you may need mTLS if your Edge Application deals with financial services and payments.

To enable this feature, contact our [Sales Team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).

6. In the **CNAME** text box, list the domains you want to use as the URL for your files. Use new lines to separate the URLs.
7. Make sure the **CNAME Access Only** switch is enabled so that the content is only accessed by the URLs listed in the CNAME field. It should be enabled automatically.
8. From the **Edge Application** dropdown list, select the application that will receive the domain.
