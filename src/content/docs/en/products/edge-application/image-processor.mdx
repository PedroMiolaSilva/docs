**Image Processor** is an **Edge Application** module that can apply filters to your images, as well as process them without any noticeable loss of visual quality. With Image Processor, you can speed up the transfer time of your content and improve user experience in your applications.

---

## 1. Instructions

This module supports the following image formats:

- JPEG
- GIF
- PNG
- BMP
- ICO
- WEBP (for [compatible browsers](https://caniuse.com/%23search=webp))

**To configure this module, follow the steps below:**

1. Access [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.
3. Select the **Edge Application** that is responsible for managing your images from your list of existing applications or add a new one with the help of our [getting started](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/) guide.
4. In the **Cache Settings** tab, add or edit a custom cache policy for your images.
5. In the **Expiration Settings** section, configure the expiration policy for your images in [Edge Caching](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-caching/).

    > **Tip**: for images, Azion recommends that you choose a larger time-to-live (TTL) values, such as the **Maximum TTL** for the **CDN Cache**, which is 7.776.000 seconds (3 months).

6. In the **Advanced Cache Key** section, choose one of the following options:

    - **Content varies by some Query String fields (Whitelist):** if you want to list all the fields in the Query String that will identify your images. **Image Processor** uses the *ims* field, so this has to be included in the list as one of the required fields for your image manager application. For this, you must enable the [Application Acceleration module](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/).
    - **Content varies by Query String, except for some fields (Blacklist):** if you only want to list those fields in the Query String that should be ignored to identify the objects in your cache. In this case, it guarantees that the *ims* field will be removed from the list. For this, you must enable the [Application Acceleration module](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/).
    - **Content varies by all Query String fields:** if you don’t know or aren’t sure about which fields to list in the Query String because you aren’t responsible for all the content in the cache or don't have the [Application Acceleration module](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) activated.

7. Edit the remaining settings as required and click the **Save** button to save your cache setting.
8. In the **Rules Engine** tab for the **Edge Application**, add or edit a custom rule for one or more image paths.
9. In the **Path** field, enter the path for your images or use the *regex* recommended by Azion:

    > If you select the parameter `$ {request_uri}`, use the regex below:

    ```regex
    \.(jpg|jpeg|gif|bmp|png)
    ```

    > If you select the parameter `$ {uri}`, use the *regex* below:

    ```regex
    \.(jpg|jpeg|gif|bmp|png)$
    ```

10. If you used the regular expression in the **Path** field, choose the logical operator **Matches**.
11. In the **Behavior** > **Set Cache Settings** field, select the preset used in Stage 2.
12. Also select **Optimize Images** in the **Behavior** field.
13. Click the **Save** button to save your rule.

From this point on, images from the configured path will be automatically processed. In addition, the **Image Processor** detects the browser's compatibility with WEBP format and, when possible, will convert the image format automatically. BMP images will also be automatically converted to JPEG or WEBP, depending on the browser's compatibility.

Follow the *Bandwidth Saving* graph through [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/) to monitor the traffic savings resulting from the processed images.

## 2. Resizing the image with auto-crop

Starting with an original image from your library, the **Image Processor** can create derived images on demand, in the size that best suits your page.

You can specify the required size as arguments in the Query String in the following structure:

```url
ims=WidthxHeight
```

Replace `Width` and `Height` with the cropped image dimensions in pixels.

To resize the image while preserving the aspect ratio, delete one of the two values, which will be calculated automatically. Use `Widthx` to specify only the width and calculate the corresponding height, or `xHeight` to specify only the height and calculate the corresponding width.

You can also specify both dimensions, `Width` and `Height`, and auto-crop the image to the required size. The cropping is centered and can be either vertical or horizontal, depending on how well the original dimensions fit the specified dimensions.

Use the value `orig` for any of the image dimensions, if you want to keep the original dimension.

**Example:**

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=880x`
(880 pixels in width, automatic height)

[![Image_Processor_1](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=880x)](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=880x)

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=880xorig`
(880 pixels in width, original height)

[![Image_Processor_2](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_2.png)](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_2.png)

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=400x`
(400 pixels in width, automatic height)

[![Image_Processor_1](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=400x)](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_2.png?ims=400x)

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=400x400`
(400 pixels in width, 400 pixels in height)

[![Image_Processor_1](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=400x400)](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=400x400)

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=x100`
(automatic width, 100 pixels in height)

[![Image_Processor_1](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=x100)](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=x100)

---

## 3. Resizing the image with fit-in 

Another way to resize an image is using fit-in:

```url
ims=fit-in/WidthxHeight
```

Replace `Width` and `Height` with the cropped image dimensions in pixels.

The derived image will be resized to fit the area specified by `WidthxHeight`. The aspect ratio of the original image is preserved, and you can hide one of the values if you wish.

If the specified area is larger than the image dimensions, the image won't be enlarged. The dimensions specified as fit-in parameters represent the maximum size limits of the area the image can occupy. One or both dimensions of the image can be smaller than its boundaries.

**Example:**

`https://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=fit-in/400x400`
(maximum width of 400 pixels and maximum height of 400 pixels)

[![Image_Processor_1](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400)](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400)

---

## 4. Cropping the image

The image cropping can be done by entering a start point (AxB) and an endpoint (CxD), as an argument in the Query String of the image URL:

```url
ims=AxB:CxD
```

- `AxB` is the starting point for the crop indicates the coordinates, in pixels, of the upper-left corner of the area to be cropped.
- `CxD` is the endpoint for the crop indicates the coordinates, in pixels, form the bottom-right corner of the area to be cropped.

**Example:**

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=430x20:910x730`
(initial coordinate at 430x20 pixels and final coordinate at 910x730 pixels)

## 5. Changing image quality 

The **Image Processor** processes your images, reducing file size and transfer time. The default quality value used is 85%, which provides optimization without any noticeable loss of visual quality.

You can set a custom quality for your images using the filter:

```url
filters:quality(Number)
```

`Number` must be a whole number between 0 and 100, which represents the level of quality you wish.

**Example:**

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=filters:quality(100)`
(100% quality)

[![Image_Processor_1](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(100))](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(100))

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=filters:quality(85)`
(85% quality)

[![Image_Processor_1](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(85))](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(85))

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=filters:quality(15)`
(15% quality)

[![Image_Processor_1](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(15))](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(15))

> To confirm whether your image is being optimized, [inspect the page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools) using your browser and find the corresponding path in the image. In the URL's query string, the `ims=VALUExVALUE` field corresponds to the resolution loaded on the page.

The `ims` parameter also allows you to alter optimization, quality, and sizing as needed. To see the original file, you only need to remove the query string added in the URL.

> **Note**: if you insert a resolution larger than the original one, the IMS will display the image with the highest possible resolution.

---

## 6. Adding a watermark to the image

To add watermarks to images using the **Image Processor**, use the following filter:

```url
filters:watermark(ImageURL,X,Y,Alpha)
```

- `ImageURL` is the URL of the image that you wish to insert as a watermark. If the URL contains parentheses, they must be coded as `%28` for “(” and `%29` for “)”.
- `X` represents the horizontal position for the watermark's insertion. Positive numbers represent the offset, in pixels, from left edge to right edge, while negative numbers represent offset from right edge to left edge. You can use the value *center*, to center the watermark horizontally, or the value *repeat*, to fill the image horizontally with repetitions of the watermark.
- `Y` represents the vertical position for the watermark's insertion. Positive numbers represent the offset, in pixels, from top to bottom, while negative numbers represent the offset from bottom to top. You can use the value *center*, to center the watermark vertically, or the value *repeat*, to fill the image vertically with repetitions of the watermark.
- `Alpha` is the transparency of the watermark. It must be a number between 0 (completely opaque) and 100 (completely transparent).

**Example:**

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=filters:watermark(http://yourdomain.com/watermark-image.png,-25,-10,50)`

---

## 7. Converting image to another format

You can convert the image to another format using the filter:

```url
filters:format(ImageFormat)
```

Where **ImageFormat** can be replaced by `webp`, `jpeg`, `gif` or `png`.

**Example:**

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=filters:format(gif)`
(converts a JPEG image into GIF)

[![Image_Processor_1](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:format(gif))](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:format(gif))

---

## 8. Filling Image

The **Image Processor** can also be used to create a derived image that is larger than the original, but instead of resizing it to the required size, you can fill the area with a custom color. Use the same [parameters as fit-in](#resize-with-fit-in) with the dimensions you want and the *fill* filter:

```url
filters:fill(Color)
```

`Color` is the fill color, following the nomenclature and codes specified by [hexadecimal values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors).

**Example:**

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(gray)`

[![Image_Processor_1](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(gray))](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(gray))

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(008080)`

[![Image_Processor_1](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(008080))](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(008080))

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(00ffff)`

[![Image_Processor_1](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(00ffff))](https://www.azion.com/static/images/docs/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(00ffff))

---

## 9. Combining filters

**Image Processor** allows you to combine the filters you want by separating each of them with `:`.

```url
filters:filter1(arg1):filter2(arg2)
```

Where **filter1(arg1)** and **filter2(arg2)** are the filters you want to apply.

**Example:**

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(gray):quality(100)`
