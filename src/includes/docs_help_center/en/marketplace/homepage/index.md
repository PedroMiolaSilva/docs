## Homepage

When you visit Markletplace’s homepage, you see two main sections: **Featured** and **New Releases**.

The solutions that have been searched, downloaded, and utilized the most, are included in the **Featured** section. They're listed on Marketplace by popularity, disregarding the licensing type (if **BYOL** or **Free**).

The **New Releases** section shows you the solutions recently updated or added to Azion’s Marketplace. For more information about the updating process, go to the [Versioning section](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/marketplace#versioning){: target="_blank"}.
