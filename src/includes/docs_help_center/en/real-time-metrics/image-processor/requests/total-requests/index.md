## Total Requests

The Total Requests graph shows you the sum of all requests related to a content that has images processed by [Image Processor](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/image-processor/).

The processing of images can be related to resizing, cropping, changing quality, or any other feature that Image Processor provides.

If an image had any kind of treatment through Image Processor, the requests to the image in the domain it's configured on are shown in the graph.
