## Total Requests per Second

The Total Requests per Second graph shows you the average of requests per second related to a content that has images processed by [Image Processor](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/image-processor/).

The processing of images can be related to resizing, cropping, changing quality, or any other feature that Image Processor provides. If an image had any kind of treatment through Image Processor, the average of requests to the image in the domain it's configured on that occurred per second during the period you've selected are shown in the graph.
