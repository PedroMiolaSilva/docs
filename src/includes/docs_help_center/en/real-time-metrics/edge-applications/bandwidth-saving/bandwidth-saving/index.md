## Bandwidth Saving

The Bandwidth Saving graph shows you the sum of savings on all transmissions of images that were somehow processed and deliver by [Image Processor](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/image-processor/).

The processing of images can be related to resizing, cropping, changing quality, or any other feature that Image Processor provides. If an image had any kind of treatment through Image Processor, the savings of those images in your domain are shown in the graph.
