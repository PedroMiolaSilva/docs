## Adding filters

Real-Time Metrics shows you a standard view of data related to all your applications, but, by using filters, you can adjust the graphs to match your requests. This way, you can view more specific data that fit your analysis.

When you add a filter, you can set the **Field**, such as "Host", "Status", or "Scheme", and the **Operator**, such as "Like", "Range", or "Not equal".

You can find more details about each field on the [Fields Metrics documentation](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/graphql-api/features/metrics-fields/) and about operators on the [Queries documentation](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-queries/#operators).

You can also set the **value field** that'll be used. Depending on the variable you chose, it can accept values of the String, Int, or Float types.

### Practical example

You want to filter your data by the amount of bandwidth saved by Image Processor, but, in the request, you only want results that are larger than a certain value.

In this situation, you should use **Bandwidth Total** and **Greater than**. In the value field, you should add the value that you want to use as a starting point, such as "10500". Then, your response will contain only amounts of bandwidth that are greater than the specific value you set.
