## Saved Requests per Second

The Saved Requests per Second graph shows the average of your edge application's requests per second that were delivered directly by Azion's edge, without having to take the extra step of looking for the content on the origin.

Whenever the content of your application is accessed, one request is processed. The graph then shows the average of all requests that were saved per second during the period you've selected in the time range.

> Saved Requests: content is delivered directly by the edge to the origin.
>
> END USER -> EDGE -> END USER

A higher average of saved requests per second means your application is using cache policies on Azion's edge more efficiently, demanding less from your origin during the period you've selected in the time range.
