## Saved Bandwidth

The Saved Bandwidth graph shows how much bandwidth was delivered directly by Azion's edge, without having to take the extra step of looking for the content on the origin.

> Saved Bandwidth: content is delivered directly by the edge to the origin.
>
> END USER -> EDGE -> END USER

A higher number of saved bandwidth means your application is using cache policies on Azion's edge more efficiently, demanding less from your origin during the period you've selected in the time range.

> Real-Time Metrics uses bits and bytes per second on all graphs related to bandwidth data. It automatically converts your data into megabits per second (bit/s) or kilobytes per second (kB/s), for example, according to the amount of data available to make your visualization easier.
