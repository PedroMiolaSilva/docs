## Bandwidth Offloaded

The Bandwidth Offloaded graph shows the percentage of bandwidth that was delivered directly by the edge, without having to search for the content on the origin before delivering it.

Bandwidth represents the amount of information being received every second. At Azion, it represents the content that was delivered by your application every second during the period you've selected in the time range.

The higher the percentage of offloading, the better the efficiency of your applications regarding the use of cache policies to preserve infrastructure. Azion's edge delivers the content from its cache, demanding less from your origin.
