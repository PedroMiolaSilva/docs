## Missed Data

The Missed Data graph shows the total sum of your edge application's data when Azion's edge had to look for the content on the origin and deliver it to the end user.

> Missed Data: the edge looks for the content on the origin and then delivers it to the end user.
>
> END USER -> EDGE -> ORIGIN -> EDGE -> END USER

When the content isn't found on Azion's cache, it's necessary to take another step and look for it on the origin, and then deliver it to the end user.
