## Total Bandwidth Usage

The Total Bandwidth Usage graph shows the total amount of bandwidth your application used during the period you've selected in the time range.

Bandwidth represents the amount of information being received every second. At Azion, it represents the content that was delivered by your application every second.

> Real-Time Metrics uses bits and bytes per second on all graphs related to bandwidth data. It automatically converts your data into megabits per second (bit/s) or kilobytes per second (kB/s), for example, according to the amount of data available to make your visualization easier.
