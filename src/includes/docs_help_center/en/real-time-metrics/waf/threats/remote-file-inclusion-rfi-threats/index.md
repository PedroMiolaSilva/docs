## Remote File Inclusion (RFI) Threats

The Remote File Inclusion (RFI) Threats graph shows you the sum of RFI attacks type made against your domains.

An RFI threat usually includes remote files or scripts to your domain, compromising your application and website's security. WAF analyzes each request and, when it's identified as a threat, blocks it.

Then, the graph displays all requests that were identified as RFI threats during the period you've selected in the time range.

For more details on how WAF analyzed the requests, see your logs through [Real-Time Events](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/){: target="_blank"}.
