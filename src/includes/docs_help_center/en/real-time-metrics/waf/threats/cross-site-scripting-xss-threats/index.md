## Cross-Site scripting (XSS) Threats

The Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Threats graph shows you the sum of XSS attacks type made against your domains.

An XSS threat injects client-side malicious scripts into pages viewed by your visitors, compromising your application and website's security. WAF analyzes each request and, when it's identified as a threat, blocks it.

Then, the graph displays all requests that were identified as XSS threats during the period you've selected in the time range.

For more details on how WAF analyzed the requests, see your logs through [Real-Time Events](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/).
