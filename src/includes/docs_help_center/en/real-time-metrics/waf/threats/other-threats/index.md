## Other Threats

The Other Threats graph shows you the sum of all requests that WAF considered as a threat and didn't fit in other specific categories, such as XSS or RFI threats.

WAF analyzes all requests made to your domains, and when it identifies one as a threat, blocks it. Then, the graph displays all requests that were identified as threats during the period you've selected in the time range.

For more details on how WAF analyzed the requests, see your logs through [Real-Time Events](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/){: target="_blank"}.
