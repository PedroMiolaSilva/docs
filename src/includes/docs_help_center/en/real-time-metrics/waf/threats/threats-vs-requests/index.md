## Threats vs Requests

The Threats vs Requests graph shows you the *sum* of attacks and regular requests made to your domain that were processed by [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/).

WAF analyzes the requests made to your domain associated with an edge application, detects, and blocks any threats it identifies as malicious activity.

> The graph displays the total amount of requests and attacks that were processed, and divides it into:

> - **Waf Requests Blocked**: requests that were identified as a malicious threat and were blocked.
> - **Waf Requests Threats**: requests that were identified as possible threats but weren't blocked.
> - **Waf Requests Allowed**: normal requests that weren't identified as a threat.

For a more detailed view on the threats occurring against your domains, see your logs through [Real-Time Events](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/).
