## SQL Injection Threats

The SQL Injection Threats graph shows you the sum of SQL Injection attacks type made against your domains.

An SQL injection threat injects a code to your domain seeking to view and attack data that they shouldn't be able to access, compromising your application and website's security. WAF analyzes each request, and when it's identified as a threat, blocks it.

Then, the graph displays all requests that were identified as SQL injection threats during the period you've selected in the time range.

For more details on how WAF analyzed the requests, see your logs through [Real-Time Events](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/){: target="_blank"}.
