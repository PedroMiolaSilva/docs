## Total Data Streamed

The Total Data Streamed graph shows you the total amount of data that was sent by the data streaming configured in your account.

Data Streaming sends your logs in packets. Once you have 2,000 records, every 60 seconds pass, or data reaches the max size you've defined, one packet is sent. The graph then shows the sum of all packets sent during the period you've selected in the time range.
