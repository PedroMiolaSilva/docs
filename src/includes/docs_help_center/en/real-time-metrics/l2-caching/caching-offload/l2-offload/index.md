## L2 Offload

The L2 Offload graph shows you the percentage of data delivered through L2 Caching, without having to search for the content on the origin before delivering it.

> EDGE -> L2 CACHING -> EDGE

The higher the percentage of offloading, the better the efficiency of your applications regarding the use of L2 cache policies to preserve infrastructure. Azion's edge delivers the content from its cache, demanding less from your origin.

### Practical example

Your application has *1 GB of data*. If the graph shows your application had an average of *80% offload*, this means *800 MB out of 1 GB* were delivered through L2 Caching.

> **In what unit does data appear on graphs?**

> Real-Time Metrics uses percentages to show your data on offload graphs. All data related to offloading reflects the average number of your applications' access, and the graph then represents it with percentages (%).
