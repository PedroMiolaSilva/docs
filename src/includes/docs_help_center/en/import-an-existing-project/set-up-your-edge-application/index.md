## Set up your edge application

This section allows you to configure the main settings for your edge application. It includes three fields you should fill in: Framework, Edge Application Name, and Root Directory.


> **Which parameters should be included in each field?**
> 
> - **Framework**: the framework used to develop your project.
> - **Edge Application Name**: the name of your application. Enter a custom, relevant name, or you can use the repository name.
> - **Root Directory**: the directory in which your code is located. Your code mustn't be located in a subdirectory, but rather be a root directory. A *./* symbol appears in this field, indicating it's a root directory.

After completing this step, go to the **Build and Output Settings** section to continue the configuration.
