## Getting to know Real-Time Manager

Welcome to **Real-Time Manager (RTM)**, Azionâ€™s configuration interface. Here you access all the available products and settings.

On RTM's header, you'll find: 

- **Products Menu**: located on the top left corner. It shows Azion products and capabilities.
- **Status** bar: it indicates how Azion's systems are operating and the status for each of the available [Edge Network's](https://www.azion.com/en/products/edge-network){: target="blank"} locations.
- **Help Center** button: it'll display documentation related to the screen you're currently on and other helpful links.
- **Account Menu**: located on the top right corner. You can see and edit your account's information there.

> **Note**: Documentation related to **RTM's** screens in the **Help Center** may not be available for all screens at the moment.

In the *Getting Started* section, you'll find three shortcuts:

- **Build an Edge Application**: this block will guide you to [build your first Edge Application from scratch](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/getting-started#build-edge-app){: target="blank"}.
- **Manage your Domains**: use this block to visit the [Domains](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains){: target="blank"} page to manage and add domains to your applications.
- **View Edge Application Metrics**: it'll take you to [Real-Time Metrics](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics){: target="blank"} to find insights based on your applications' performance, availability, and security. 

Right after you find the shortcut to **Invite Your Team**. This is an optional step, but you can invite your team to work together on Azion. Find out more about [Teams Permissions](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/accounts/users-and-teams){: target="blank"}.

Finally, you can find Azion's product categories that will guide you through your Azion journey and help you set up your applications: **Build**, **Secure**, **Deploy**, and **Observe**.
